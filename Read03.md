 - HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.
   - Tags are often referred to as elements.
   - Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.
   - Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
     about the content of that element.
   - Attributes require a name and a value.
