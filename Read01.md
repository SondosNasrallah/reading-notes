### GitHub which is the most direct path to create websites and projects uses a special version of Markdown syntax.

 
 ## What Makes GitHub so special?
- There is no database to set up.
- no server to configure.
- in many cases you don't have to know HTML.

## How does GitHub works?
1. it serves all your project sites from personal URL tight to your username or organization.
2. it looks for web content for your project in a special branch for site tight to an existing repository, this branch is separated from your code.
3. You can create a site for yourself or organization by creating a repository with your GitHub pages URL as it's name and adding web content it's masterbranch.
4. you can drag and drop your files straight into your browser to upload them.
