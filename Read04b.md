# Computer architecture and logic: 
## How Computers work? 

** 1. What makes a computer a computer?** 
- Computers are thimking machines that help us in manipulate information. 
- to design a thinking machine it had to perform 4 different tasks:
   - Input : Tells computer what to do.
   - Storage information in a memory.
   - Processing : taking information from memory, manipulates it or change it usinf algorithm which is a series of commands and then it sends the processed information back to be stored in memory again.
   - Output : which varies depending on what computer designed to do.


 ** 2. Binary & Data**
  - computers work on ones and zeroes that play in how computers work inside. 
  - inside computers are electrical wires and circuits that carry all the information.
  - If you have a single wire with electricity flowing through it the signal could be represented with anything that had only 2 options (1/0)(Yes/No)(True/False).. electrical

     >> this 2 options state of single wire called : Bit, which is the smallest piece od information a computer can store.


 - There are Two main types of numbers systems in computer shown in the table below. 

    | Decimal Number System | Binary Number System |
    |-----------------------|----------------------|
    | uses ten digits from 0-9 | uses two digits (0.1) | 

  - Text, images, sounds, can be represented with numbers: 
    - All graphics, images, videos madeout of pixels, each pixel has a color and each color represented with numbers.
    - Sound in binary is a series of vibration in the air which can be represented graphically as a wave form (any point on this wave  form can be represented bu numbers).

    
** 3. Circuits and Logic**

 - Circuits are tiny electronic components in computer used to modify and combine the input signals (in order to process info that comes as input). {types shown below}

 ** 4. CPU, Memory, Input and Output:** 
    CPU is the masterchip that controls all the other parts of the computer, it has circuits to do math and logic, and circuits to send and recieve information too. 

>> CPU recieves special commands that tell it which circuit to use.

 - Operating system (OS) of the computer is the master programe that manages how software getts to use the hardware of the computer. 
    - OS manage software that controls the computer's hardware.
    - The software is a series of commands made of simple binary code and that binary code is just electrical signals flowing through billions of tiny circuits.
