# Text editor
- A text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on your computer, or you access online through your web browser, that allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. The text editor has to be one of the most important tools you can use as an aspiring web developer.

**Features**
   1. code completion
   2. syntax highlighting
   3. a nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and
        fatigue). 
   4. the ability to choose from a healthy selection of
      extensions available when you need them.

  **Using The Software That Already Comes With Your Computer**

   - on Linux computers, each distribution will have its own text editor already installed but which one might depend on the flavor of your particular distribution.
   - the text editors that come on your computer don’t have many features to speak of. They’re the barest bare bones text editors you’ll encounter.
   - If you want to try using the text editors that come with your computer, there’s a couple of caveats that you should be aware of:
      - make sure that that you’re creating code in a plain text editor.
      - make sure that you first create a folder on your computer somewhere to store your entire website. 
      - make sure that when you’re saving your file, that they have the appropriate extension at the end of the file names.

# Linux Tutorial 
- Linux has a graphical user interface and it works pretty    much like the GUI's on other systems that you are           familiar with such as Windows and OSX.
- A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to   the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them   on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you           similarly as text.


**Navigation**
  -  *pwd* command is Print Working Directory, It tells you what your current or present working directory is. Give it a try now.
  -  *ls* command  tells you What's in Our Current Location.
  - *cd* Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.
  -  Absolute and Relative Paths:
     1.  Relative path
        A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
    2. Absolute path
        A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.
  - /etc - Stores config files for the system.
  - /var/log - Stores log files for various system programs. (You may not have permission to look at everything in this directory. Don't let that stop you exploring though. A few error messages never hurt anyone.)
  - /bin - The location of several commonly used programs (some of which we will learn about in the rest of this tutorial.
  - /usr/bin - Another location for programs on the system.


**More About Files**
- file : obtain information about what type of file a file or directory is.
- ls -a : List the contents of a directory, including hidden files.
- Everything is a file under Linux, Even directories.
- Linux is case sensitive : Beware of silly typos.
